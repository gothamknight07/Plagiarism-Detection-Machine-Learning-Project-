# Plagiarism-Detection-Machine-Learning-Project-
In this project, I have build a plagiarism detector that identifies a text similarity and performs binary classification; labeling that file as either *plagiarized* or *not*, depending on how similar that text file is to a provided source text.

Detecting plagiarism is a critical task in the academic and content creation world. This repository contains code for a Plagrasim Detection Machine Learning Project using binary classification. We leverage the power of PyTorch to build and train a model capable of identifying plagiarized content effectively.

## Key features of this project:
- Utilizes the PyTorch framework for machine learning.
- Implements various text similarity measures and features.
- Provides a flexible and extensible codebase for further research.
- Offers a straightforward way to train and evaluate models on custom datasets.
